# Spaarc documentation


## Overview

SPAARC-Radiomics is a tool for multimodal quantitative image analysis developed at Cardiff University School of 
Engineering. SPAARC-Radiomics includes a total of 164 features: 23 Morphology, 
18 Intensity-based Statistics, 23 Intensity Histogram (IH), 7 Intensity-Volume Histogram (IVH),
25 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), 16 Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), 
16 Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), 16 Gray Level Distance Zone Matrix (GLDZM), 
5 Neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTLDM), and 15 Neighborhood Gray Level 
Dependence Matrix (NGLDM). SPAARC-Radiomics features comply with the definitions provided 
by the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) and are standardized following the 
IBSI guidelines (https://theibsi.github.io).
